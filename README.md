# groupproj rubric

In this project, you will build upon the Card, Deck, and GraphicalCard objects demonstrated in class to create an interactive application.  
  You are free to use your own creative ideas, but your application must at minimum display cards on the screen and allow the user to interact with them in some way.  
  
  Some examples might include:

    A solitaire game
    War!
    Poker
    Create a new type of deck (Tarot, Pokemon, MTG, etc) and build an app on that.

This is a group project.  You will form one or more groups.  You will have class time in weeks 13 and 14 to work with your group to complete the project. 
  During the final class period of the semester you will demonstrate your application.

The resources for the assignment are in the attached zip file.


The final deliverables will include your application files, and any resources required to make the application work (e.g. pictures, sounds, etc.).  
  Note that you do not need to turn in any of the provided files (card.py, deck.py, graphicalcard.py, button.py, or the standard card images) 
    (unless you have made modifications to them.)
