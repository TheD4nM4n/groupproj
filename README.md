# WAR in Python 3

This project was created by Josiah, Keito, Dipendra, and Daniel in Harrisburg University's CISC 120 course. This game utilizes libraries provided in the book *Introduction to Programming in Python: An Interdisciplinary Approach*, and creates a simple card game based off of *War!*.

## Running the game
Install stdio, stddraw, and the other standard libraries from [the booksite](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/home/). Then, download and extract the .zip, and run main.py while within the working directory ./groupproj/. Enjoy!
